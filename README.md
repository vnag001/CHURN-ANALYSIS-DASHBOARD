# CHURN-ANALYSIS-DASHBOARD

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an interactive Churn Analysis Dashboard to identify patterns of customer attrition and provide actionable insights for improving customer retention strategies.

The analysis examines customer demographics, purchase behavior, service usage, and engagement trends to predict churn risk and help businesses take proactive measures.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Data visualization & dashboarding

Excel – Data preprocessing & exploratory analysis

(Optional if used) Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn) – Advanced churn modeling

🔍 Key Objectives

Identify high-risk customers likely to churn.

Explore drivers of churn such as tenure, service usage, and support interactions.

Build an interactive dashboard for real-time churn tracking.

Provide business recommendations to reduce customer attrition.

📊 Approach

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values, standardized categorical variables.

Created calculated fields for churn indicators.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Customer segmentation based on usage, tenure, and demographics.

Churn rate comparisons across multiple dimensions.

Dashboarding

Power BI dashboard includes:

Churn by customer segment (tenure, age, geography)

Churn by product/service usage

KPIs (Churn %, Retention %, Customer Lifetime Value impact)

Trend analysis for churn over time

✅ Key Insights

Customers with shorter tenure showed significantly higher churn rates.

Low engagement customers (infrequent logins, minimal usage) were at greater churn risk.

Support-related issues had a direct correlation with higher churn probability.

📂 Deliverables

Power BI Dashboard (interactive & drill-down enabled)

SQL scripts for churn data ETL and analysis

Documentation summarizing churn drivers & recommendations

🚀 Business Impact

The dashboard enables businesses to:

Identify and target at-risk customers for retention campaigns.

Optimize marketing spend by focusing on high-value customers.

Improve customer satisfaction by addressing churn drivers proactively.
